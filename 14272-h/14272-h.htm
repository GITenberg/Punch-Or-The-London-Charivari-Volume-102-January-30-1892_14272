    <p>Why I am not a success in literature it is difficult for me
    to tell; indeed, I would give a good deal to anyone who would
    explain the reason. The Publishers, and Editors, and Literary
    Men decline to tell me <i>why</i> they do not want my
    contributions. I am sure I have done all that I can to succeed.
    When my Novel, <i>Geoffrey's Cousin</i>, comes back from the
    Row, I do not lose heart&mdash;I pack it up, and send it off
    again to the Square, and so, I may say, it goes the round. The
    very manuscript attests the trouble I have taken. Parts of it
    are written in my own hand, more in that of my housemaid, to
    whom I have dictated passages; a good deal is in the hand of my
    wife. There are sentences which I have written a dozen times,
    on the margins, with lines leading up to them in red ink. The
    story is written on paper of all sorts and sizes, and bits of
    paper are pasted on, here and there, containing revised
    versions of incidents and dialogue. The whole packet is now far
    from clean, and has a business-like and travelled air about it,
    which should command respect. I always accompany it with a
    polite letter, expressing my willingness to cut it down, or
    expand it, or change the conclusion. Nobody can say that I am
    proud. But it always comes back from the Publishers and
    Editors, without any explanation as to why it will not do. This
    is what I resent as particularly hard. The Publishers decline
    to tell me what their Readers have really said about it. I have
    forwarded <i>Geoffrey's Cousin</i> to at least five or six
    notorious authors, with a letter, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;You will be surprised at receiving a
        letter from a total stranger, but your well-known goodness
        of heart must plead my excuse. I am aware that your time is
        much occupied, but I am certain that you will spare enough
        of that valuable commodity to glance through the
        accompanying MS. Novel, and give me your frank opinion of
        it. Does it stand in need of any alterations, and, if so,
        what? Would you mind having it published <i>under your own
        name</i>, receiving one-third of the profits? A speedy
        answer will greatly oblige."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Would you believe it, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, not one of these
    over-rated and overpaid men has ever given me any advice at
    all? Most of them simply send back my parcel with no reply.
    One, however, wrote to say that he received at least six such
    packets every week, and that his engagements made it impossible
    for him to act as a guide, counsellor, and friend to the
    amateurs of all England. He added that, if I published the
    Novel at my own expense, the remarks of the public critics
    would doubtless prove most valuable and salutary.</p>

    <p>This decided me; I <i>did</i> publish, at my own expense,
    with Messrs. SAUL, SAMUEL, MOSS &amp; CO. I had to pay down
    £150, then £35 for advertisements, then £70 for Publisher's
    Commission. Other expenses fell grievously on me, as I sent
    round printed postcards to everyone whose name is in the Red
    Book, asking them to ask for <i>Geoffrey's Cousin</i> at the
    Libraries. I also despatched six copies, with six anonymous
    letters, to Mr. GLADSTONE, signing them, "A Literary
    Constituent," "A Wavering Anabaptist," and so forth, but,
    extraordinary to relate, I have received no answer, and no
    notice has been taken of my disinterested presents. The reviews
    were of the most meagre and scornful description. Messrs. SAUL,
    SAMUEL, Moss &amp; Co. have just written to me, begging me to
    remove the "remainder" of my book, and charging £23
    15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for warehouse expenses. Yet, when I
    read <i>Geoffrey's Cousin</i>, I fail to see that it falls, in
    any way, beneath the general run of novels. I enclose a marked
    copy, and solicit your earnest attention for the passage in
    which <i>Geoffrey's Cousin</i> blights his hopes for ever. The
    story, Sir, is one of controversy, and is suited to this time.
    <i>Geoffrey McPhun</i> is an Auld Licht (see Mr. BARRIE's
    books, <i>passim</i>). His cousin is an Esoteric Buddhist. They
    love each other dearly, but <i>Geoffrey</i>, a rigid character,
    cannot marry any lady who does not burn, as an Auld Licht,
    "with a hard gem-like flame." <i>Violet Blair</i>, his cousin,
    is just as staunch an Esoteric Buddhist. Nothing stands between
    them but the differences of their creed.</p>

    <p>"How can I contemplate, GEOFFREY," said VIOLET, with a rich
    blush, "the possibility of seeing our little ones stray from
    the fold of the Lama of Thibet into a chapel of the Original
    Secession Church?"</p>

    <p>They determine to try to convert each other. <i>Geoffrey</i>
    lends <i>Violet</i> all his theological library, including
    WODROW's <i>Analecta</i>. She lends him the learned works of
    Mr. SINNETT and Madame BLAVATSKY. They retire, he to the
    Himalayas, she to Thrums, and their letters compose Volume II.
    (Local colour <i>à la</i> KIPLING and BARRIE.) On the slopes of
    the Himalayas you see <i>Geoffrey</i> converted; he becomes a
    Cheela, and returns by overland route. He rushes to Ramsgate,
    and announces his complete acceptance of the truth as it is in
    Mahatmaism. Alas! alas! <i>Violet</i> has been over-persuaded
    by the seductions of Presbyterianism, she has hurried down from
    Thrums, rejoicing, a full-blown Auld Licht. And, in her
    <i>Geoffrey</i>, she finds a convinced Esoteric Buddhist! They
    are no better off than they were, their union is impossible,
    and Vol. III. ends in their poignant anguish.</p>

    <p>Now, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, is not this the very novel for the
    times; rich in adventure (in Kafiristan), teeming with
    philosophical suggestiveness, and sparkling with all the
    epigrams of my commonplace book. Yet I am about £300 out of
    pocket, and, moreover, a blighted being.</p>

    <p>I have taken every kind of pains; I have asked London
    Correspondents to dinner; I have written flattering letters to
    everybody; I have attempted to get up a deputation of Beloochis
    to myself; I have tried to make people interview me; I have
    puffed myself in all the modes which study and research can
    suggest. If anybody has, I have been "up to date." But Fortune
    is my foe, and I see others flourish by the very arts which
    fail in my hands.</p>

    <p>I mention my Novel because its failure really is a mystery.
    But I am not at all more fortunate in the reception of my
    poetry. I have tried it every way&mdash;ballades by the bale,
    sonnets by the dozen, loyal odes, seditious songs, drawing-room
    poetry, an Epic on the history of Labducuo, erotic verse, all
    fire, foam, and fangs, reflective ditto, humble natural ballads
    about signal-men and newspaper-boys, Life-boat rescues, Idyls,
    Nocturnes in rhyme, tragedies in blank verse. Nobody will print
    them, or, if anybody prints them, he regrets that he cannot pay
    for them. My moral and discursive essays are rejected, my
    descriptions of nature do not even get into the newspapers. I
    have not been elected by the Sydenham Club (a clique of
    humbugs); I have let my hair grow long; I have worn a cloak and
    a Tyrolese hat, and attitudinised in the picture-galleries, but
    nobody asked who I am. I have endeavoured to hang on to
    well-known poets and novelists&mdash;they have not welcomed my
    advances.</p>

    <p>My last dodge was a Satire, the <i>Logrolliad</i>, in which
    I lashed the charlatans and pretenders of the day.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>While hoary statesmen scribble in reviews</p>

            <p>And guide the doubtful verdict of the Blues,</p>

            <p>While HAGGARD scrawls, with blood in lieu of
            ink,</p>

            <p>While MALLOCK teaches Marquises to think,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>so long I have rhythmically expressed my design to wield the
    dripping scourge of satire. But nobody seems a penny the worse,
    and I am not a paragraph the better. Short stories of a
    startling description fill my drawers, nobody will venture on
    one of them. I have closely imitated every writer who succeeds,
    but my little barque may attendant sail, it pursues the
    triumph, but does not partake the gale.</p>

    <p>I am now engaged on a Libretto for an heroic opera.</p>

    <i>in</i> Venice yet. It's up at the top o' them steps.</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> Up all them stairs? Well, I 'ope it'll be
    worth seeing when we <i>do</i> get there, that's all!</p>

    <p><i>An Attendant</i> (<i>as she arrives at the top</i>). Not

    <p><i>The Opt. Husb.</i> You needn't go all the way down again,

    Oh, <i>there</i> they are. 'Ere, LIZZIE and JEM, keep along o'
    me and Father, do, or we shan't see half of what's to be
    seen!</p>

    <p><i>Lizzie</i>. Oh, all right, Ma; don't you worry so!
    (<i>To</i> JEM, <i>her fiancé</i>.) Don't those tall fellows

    they call <i>them</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Jem</i> (<i>a young man, who thinks for himself</i>).
    Well, I shouldn't wonder if those were the parties they call
    "Doges"&mdash;sort o' police over there, d'ye see?</p>

    <p><i>Lizzie</i>. They're 'andsomer than 'elmets, I will say
    <i>that</i> for them. (<i>They enter Modern Venice, amidst
    cries of "This way for Gondoala Tickets! Pass along, please!

    a foreign look, with all those queer names written up. Think
    it's like what it is, JEM?</p>

    <p><i>Jem</i>. Bound to be, with all the money they've spent on
    it. I daresay they've idle-ised it a bit, though.</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> Where are all these kinals they talk so much
    about? I don't see none!</p>

    <p><i>Jem</i> (<i>as a break in the crowd reveals a narrow
    olive-green channel</i>). Why, what d'ye call <i>that</i>,
    Ma?</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> That a kinal! Why, you don't mean to tell me
    any barge 'ud&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Opt. Husb.</i> Go on!&mdash;you didn't suppose you'd
    find the Paddington Canal in <i>these</i> parts, did you? This
    is big enough for all <i>they</i> want. (<i>A gondola goes by
    lurchily, crowded with pot-hatted passengers, smoking pipes,
    and wearing the uncomfortable smile of children enjoying their
    first elephant-ride.</i>) That's one o' these 'ere
    gondoalers&mdash;it's a rum-looking concern, ain't it? But I
    suppose you get <i>used</i> to
    'em&mdash;(<i>philosophically</i>)&mdash;like everything
    else!</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> It gives me the creeps to look at 'em. Talk
    about <i>'earses</i>!</p>

    <p><i>The Opt. Husb.</i> Well, look 'ere, we've come out to
    enjoy ourselves&mdash;what d'ye say to having a ride in one,
    eh?</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> You won't ketch me trusting <i>my</i>self in
    one o' them tituppy things, so don't you deceive yourself!</p>

    <p><i>The Opt. Husb.</i> Oh, it's on'y two foot o' warm water
    if you do tip over. <i>Come</i> on! (<i>Hailing</i> Gondolier,
    <i>who has just landed his cargo.</i>) 'Ere, 'ow much'll you

    <p><i>Gondolier</i> (<i>gesticulating</i>). Teekits! you tek
    teekits&mdash;là&mdash;you vait!</p>

    <p><i>Jem</i>. He means we've got to go to the orfice and take
    tickets and stand in a cue, d'yer see?</p>

    <p><i>The P.M.</i> Me go and form a cue down there and get
    squeeged like at the Adelphi Pit, all to set in a rickety
    gondoaler! I can see all <i>I</i> want to see without messing
    about in one o' them things!</p>

    <p><i>The Others</i>. Well, I dunno as it's worth the extry
    sixpence, come to think of it. (<i>They pass on,
    contentedly.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Jem</i>. We're on the Rialto Bridge now, LIZZIE, d'ye
    see? The one in SHAKSPEARE, <i>you</i> know.</p>

    <p><i>Lizzie</i>. That's the one they call the "Bridge o'
    Sighs," ain't it? (<i>Hazily.</i>) Is that because there's
    <i>shops</i> on it?</p>

    <p><i>Jem</i>. I dessay. Shops&mdash;or else suicides.</p>

    <p><i>Lizzie</i> (<i>more hazily than ever</i>). Ah, the same
    as the Monument. (<i>They walk on with a sense of mental
    enlargement.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Lavender Salt</i>. It's wonderfully like the real
    thing, LAVENDER, isn't it? Of course they can't <i>quite</i>
    get the true Venetian atmosphere!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. L.S.</i> Well, MIMOSA, they'd have the Sanitary
    Authorities down on them if they <i>did</i>, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.S.</i> Oh, you're so horribly unromantic! But,
    LAVENDER, couldn't we get one of those gondolas and go about.
    It would be so lovely to be in one again, and fancy ourselves
    back in dear Venice, now <i>wouldn't</i> it?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. L.S.</i> The illusion is cheap at sixpence; so come
    along, MIMOSA!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He secures, tickets, and presently the</i> LAVENDER
        SALTS, <i>find themselves part of a long queue, being
        marshalled between barriers by Italian gendarmes in a state
        of politely suppressed amusement.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.S.</i> (<i>over her shoulder to her husband, as
    she imagines</i>). I'd no idea we should have to go through all
    this! Must we really herd in with all these people? Can't we
    two manage to get a gondola all to ourselves?</p>

    <p><i>A Voice</i> (<i>not</i> LAVENDER's&mdash;<i>in her
    ear</i>). I'm sure I'm 'ighly flattered, Mum, but I'm already
    suited; yn't I, DYSY?</p>

    <blockquote>

    and then they'd ha' kep' the place clear of us common people
    for yer! [Mrs. L.S. <i>is sorry she spoke.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>IN THE GONDOLA.&mdash;Mr. <i>and</i> Mrs. L.S. <i>are
        seated in the back seat, supported on one side by the</i>
        Humorous 'ARRY <i>and his Fiancée, and on the other by a
        pale, bloated youth, with a particularly rank cigar, and
        the</i> Sturdy Democrat, <i>whose two small boys occupy the
        seat in front.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The St. Dem.</i> (<i>with malice aforethought</i>). If

       lady won't mind takin' one of yer on her lap. (<i>To</i>
       Mrs. L.S., <i>who is frozen with horror at the
       suggestion.</i>) They're 'umin beans, Mum, like yerself!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.S.</i> (<i>desperately ignoring her other
    neighbours</i>). Isn't that lovely balcony there copied from
    the one at the Pisani, LAVENDER&mdash;or is it the Contarini? I
    forget.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. L.S.</i> Don't remember&mdash;got the Rialto rather
    well, haven't they? I suppose that's intended for the dome of
    the Salute down there&mdash;not quite the outline, though, if I
    remember right. And, if that's the Campanile of St. Mark, the
    colour's too brown, eh?</p>

    <p><i>The Hum. 'Arry</i> (<i>with intention</i>). Oh, I sy,
    DYSY, yn't that the Kempynoily of Kennington Oval, right
    oppersite? and 'aven't they got the Grand Kinel in the Ole Kent
    Road proper, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Dysy</i> (<i>playing up to him, with enjoyment</i>). Jest
    'aven't they! On'y I don't quoite remember whether the colour
    o' them gas-lamps is correct. But there, if we go on torkin'
    this w'y, other parties might think we wanted to show orf!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.S.</i> Do you remember our <i>last</i> gondola
    expedition, LAVENDER, coming home from the Giudecca in that
    splendid sunset?</p>

    <p><i>The Hum. A.</i> Recklect you and me roidin' 'ome from
    Walworth on a rhinebow, DYSY, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Chorus of Chaff from the bridges and terraces as they
    pass.</i> 'Ullo, 'ere comes another boat-load! 'Igher up,
    there!... Four-wheeler!... Ain't that toff in the tall 'at
    enjoyin' himself? Quite a 'appy funeral! &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.S.</i> (<i>faintly, as they enter the Canal in
    front of the Stage</i>). LAVENDER, dear, I really can't stand
    this <i>much</i> longer!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. L.S.</i> (<i>to the</i> Bloated Youth). Might I ask
    you, Sir, not to puff your smoke in this lady's face&mdash;it's
    extremely unpleasant for her!</p>

    <p><i>The B.Y.</i> All right, Mister, I'm always ready to
    oblige a lydy&mdash;but&mdash;(<i>with wounded
    pride</i>)&mdash;as to its bein' <i>unpleasant</i>, yer know,
    all <i>I</i> can tell yer is&mdash;(<i>with
    sarcasm</i>)&mdash;that this 'appens to be one of the best
    tuppeny smokes in 'Ammersmith!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. L.S.</i> (<i>diplomatically</i>). I am sure of
    that&mdash;from the aroma, but if you <i>could</i> kindly
    postpone its enjoyment for a little while, we should be
    extremely obliged!</p>

    <p><i>The B.Y.</i> Well, I must keep it <i>aloive</i>, yer
    know. If there's anyone 'ere that understands cigars, they'll
    bear me out as it never smokes the same when you once let it
    out.</p>

    <h2>POLITE LITERATURE.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Having seen in the pages of one of
    your contemporaries several deeply interesting letters telling
    of "the Courtesy of the CAVENDISH," I think it will be pleasing
    to your readers to learn that I have a fund of anecdote
    concerning the politeness&mdash;the true politeness&mdash;of
    many other members of the Peerage. Perhaps you will permit me
    to give you a few instances of what I may call aristocratic
    amiability.</p>

    <p>On one occasion the Duke of DITCHWATER and a Lady entered
    the same omnibus simultaneously. There was but one seat, and
    noticing that His Grace was standing, I called attention to the
    fact. "Certainly," replied His Grace, with a quiet smile, "but
    if I had sat down, the Lady would not have enjoyed her present
    satisfactory position!" The Lady herself had taken the until
    then vacant place!</p>

    <p>Shortly afterwards I met Viscount VERMILION walking in an
    opposite direction to the path I myself was pursuing. "My
    Lord," I murmured, removing my hat, "I was quite prepared to
    step into the gutter." "It was unnecessary," returned his
    Lordship, graciously, "for as the path was wide, there was room
    enough for both of us to pass on the same pavement!"</p>

    <p>On a very wet evening I saw My Lord TOMNODDICOMB coming from
    a shop in Piccadilly. Noticing that his Lordship had no defence
    against the weather, I ventured to offer the Peer my
    <i>parapluie</i>.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/59-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/59-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Please let me get into my carriage," observed his Lordship.
    Then discovering, from my bowing attitude, that I meant no
    insolence by my suggestion, he added,&mdash;"And as for your
    umbrella&mdash;surely on this rainy night you can make use of
    it yourself?"</p>

    <p>Yet again. The Marchioness of LOAMSHIRE was on the point of
    crossing a puddle.</p>

    <p>Naturally I divested myself of my greatcoat, and threw it as
    a bridge across her Ladyship's dirty walk.</p>

    <p>The Marchioness smiled, but her Ladyship has never forgotten

        <p>["All the judicial wisdom of the Supreme Court has met
        in solemn and secret conclave, heralded by letters from the
        heads of the Bench, admitting serious evils in the working
        of the High Court of Justice; a full working day was
        appropriated for the occasion; the learned Judges met at 11
        A.M. (nominally) and rose promptly for luncheon, and for
        the day, at 1·30 P.M. Two-and-a-half hours' work, during
        which each of the twenty-eight judicial personages no doubt
        devoted all his faculties and experience to the discovery,
        discussion, and removal of the admittedly numerous defects
        in the working of the Judicature Acts! Two-and-a-half
        hours, which might have been stolen from the relaxations of
        a Saturday afternoon! Two-and-a-half hours, for which the
        taxpayers of the United Kingdom pay some eight hundred
        guineas! Truly the spectacle is eminently calculated to
        inspire the country with confidence and hopes of

    have we to do with the Public? But in case there should be any
    truth in this extraordinary statement, I think we might as well
    appoint a Committee to look into it, and then we can meet again
    some day and hear what it is all about.</p>

    <p><i>L.C.J.</i> Yes, a Committee by all means; the smaller the
    better. "Too many cooks," as dear old HORACE puts it.</p>

    <p><i>M.R.</i> Talking of cooks, isn't it about lunch time?</p>

    <p>MONDAY, <i>Jan.</i> 18, 1892. "Bath and West of England's
    Society's Cheese School at Frome." Of this School, the
    <i>Times</i>, judging by results, speaks highly of "the
    practical character of the instruction given at the School."
    This is a bad look-out for Eton and Harrow, not to say for
    Winchester and Westminster also. All parents who wish their
    children to be "quite the cheese" in Society generally, and
    particularly for Bath and the West of England, where, of
    course, Society is remarkably exclusive, cannot do better, it
    is evident, than send them to the Bath and West of England

    <p>One of the Baron's Deputy-Readers has been looking through
    Mr. G.W. HENLEY's <i>Lyra Heroica; a Book of Verse for
    Boys</i>. DAVID NUTT, London.) This is his
    appreciation:&mdash;Mr. HENLEY has tacked his name to a
    collection which contains some noble poems, some (but not much)
    trash, and a good many pieces, which, however poetical they may
    be, are certainly not heroic, seeing that they do not express
    "the simpler sentiments, and the more elemental emotions" (I
    use Mr. HENLEY's prefatory words), and are scarcely the sort of
    verse that boys are likely, or ought to care about. To be sure,
    Mr. HENLEY guards himself on the score of his "personal
    equation"&mdash;I trust his boys understand what he means. My
    own personal equation makes me doubt whether Mr. HENLEY has
    done well in including such pieces as, for instance, HERBERT's
    "<i>Memento Mori</i>," CURRAN's "<i>The Deserter</i>,"
    SWINBURNE's "<i>The Oblation</i>," and ALFRED AUSTIN's "<i>Is
    Life Worth Living</i>?" If Mr. HENLEY, or anybody else who
    happens to possess a personal equation, will point out to me
    the heroic quality in these poems, I shall feel deeply
    grateful. And how, in the name of all that is or ever was
    heroic, has "<i>Auld Lang Syne</i>" crept into this collection
    of heroic verse? As for Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN, I cannot think by
    what right he secures a place in such a compilation. I have
    rarely read a piece of his which did not contain at least one
    glaring infelicity. In "<i>Is Life Worth Living</i>?" he tells
    us of "blithe herds," which (in compliance with the obvious
    necessities of rhyme, but for no other reason)</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Wend homeward with unweary feet,</p>

            <p>Carolling like the birds."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Further on we find that</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"England's trident-sceptre roams</p>

            <p>Her territorial seas,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>merely because the unfortunate sceptre has to rhyme somehow
    to "English homes."</p>

    <p>But I have a further complaint against Mr. HENLEY. He
    presumes, in the most fantastic manner, to alter the well-known
    titles of celebrated poems. "<i>The Isles of Greece</i>" is
    made to masquerade as "The Glory that was Greece"; "<i>Auld
    Lang Syne</i>" becomes "The Goal of Life," and "<i>Tom
    Bowline</i>" is converted into "The Perfect Sailor." This
    surely (again I use the words of Mr. HENLEY) "is a thing
    preposterous, and distraught." On the whole, I cannot think
    that Mr. HENLEY has done his part well. His manner is bad. His
    selection, it seems to me, is open to grave censure, on broader
    grounds than the mere personally equational of which he speaks,
    and his choppings, and sub-titles, and so forth, are not
    commendable. The irony of literary history has apparently
    ordained that Mr. HENLEY should first patronise, and then
    "cut," both CAMPBELL and MACAULAY. Was the shade of MACAULAY
    disturbed when he learnt that Mr. HENLEY considered his
    "<i>Battle of Naseby</i>" both "vicious and ugly"?</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
